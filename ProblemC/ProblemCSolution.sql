Question1 . 
a) a.	Given whatever you design, write a query that is as performant as you can make it that shows how many pets were enrolled on the day Mount St. Helens erupted.
Answer.
 Some Assumption: 
1)PetOwner Will have one policy Number under which his all pets enrolled.
2)Policy Should have atleast one pet.

--c)c.	Given whatever you design, create a stored procedure that transfers all pets from one owner to another owner.  
--If an owner has multiple pets, do them one at a time.  
--If transfer fails during operation, the data should not be left in an inconsistent or invalid state.
--i.	Do you like the stipulation of doing one at a time?  Yes/no why?

--I am using Transaction to roll back if something goes wrong during transfer

--2)
--Do you like the stipulation of doing one at a time?  Yes/no why?
Answer:
--NO, As we need maintain Transcation (ACID property), Sql server can take care of this as SQL server Query engine optimizes the query.

--d) Given whatever you design, create the most performant implementation you can that allows for finding pets by breed name.  This design can be useless for all other scenarios and impractical as long as it meets the given criteria
Answer:
-- De-Normalizing Table to have Breed details into the same table to avoid join. and adding clustered index on breed and non-clustered on id

--Answer:
SELECT * FROM [PetForBreedSearch] WHERE Breed = 'SomeBreedName'
--e) Create a stored procedure that generates policy numbers for the pet owner upon enrollment.  The format for the policy number should be [COUNTRYCODE][AUTOINCREMENT] where [COUNTRYCODE] is the 3 character ISO country code and [AUTOINCREMENT] is an incrementing number that starts from zero.  The policy number must be 13 characters long at all times.  It should not be possible to hand out a duplicate policy number given two pet owners enrolling at the same time.  Answer the following questions
--Answer:
CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[GetPolicyNumber]
	@OwnerID INT,
	@PolicyId CHAR(13) OUTPUT
AS
BEGIN
DECLARE  @isocode INT;
SELECT @isocode = c.IsoCode FROM [dbo].[PetOwner] AS po JOIN [dbo].[Country] AS c ON po.countryid = c.Id
SELECT @isocode+REPLICATE('0',10-LEN(RTRIM(@PolicyId))) + RTRIM(@PolicyId)
END
/*
i.	Do you believe your policy number algorithm is scalable under heavy new enrollment load?
Answer : Yes if its in trigger. Logic will work.
ii.	Is the best place for this code inside of an SQL stored procedure or somewhere else?
Anser : Trigger Should be the best place for this logic.
